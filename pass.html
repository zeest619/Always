                But you don't want to hear this, right?<br>
                You would rather listen to<br>
                anyone and everyone<br>

                Some dead yet living<br>

                Jane Austen<br>
                <br>
                "My dearest friend, on this most felicitous occasion of your birth, <br>
                I cannot but express the warmest sentiments of affection and esteem. <br>
                How fortunate the world is to be graced by your presence,<br>
                 a true paragon of wit, grace, and good sense.<br>
                  May this day, and all the days that follow,<br>
                   be filled with the greatest joys, <br>
                   unmarred by any vexations,<br>
                    and may your path be ever illuminated by the happiness <br>
                    you so richly deserve. Your worth, I need hardly say, <br>
                    is far beyond any trifling praise I could offer.<br>
                     Happy Birthday, most beloved of friends."<br>

                     Oscar Wilde<br>
                     <br>
                     "My dear friend,<br>
                      how utterly delightful it is that we should celebrate <br>
                      the anniversary of your arrival into this rather tiresome world.<br>
                       You, who possess such a rare beauty of spirit,<br>
                        are a beacon of charm and elegance,<br>
                         standing gloriously apart from the ordinary. <br>
                         May your day be filled with laughter, <br>
                         the finest pleasures, and an abundance of wit, <br>
                         for it is only the extraordinary who deserve anything at all. <br>
                         To grow older is a privilege denied to many, but in you,<br>
                          age shall only enhance what is already magnificent.<br>
                           Happy Birthday, to the most brilliant of souls."<br>

                           "On this day, as the world turns and time flows endlessly, <br>
                           I pause to reflect on the quiet beauty of your existence. <br>
                           How extraordinary it is, the passage of days, years, <br>
                           and yet how quietly significant each moment becomes <br>
                           when touched by your presence. <br>
                           Your life, woven with thought, <br>
                           feeling, and memory,<br>
                            stands like a ripple in the vast sea of time, enduring,<br>
                             profound, luminous.<br>
                              I wish for you,<br>
                               on this birthday, <br>
                               a time of stillness and joy,<br>
                                a moment where all the fragments of life gather in harmony, <br>
                                and you, <br>
                                dear friend, are at the center, bright and unyielding.<br>
                                 Happy Birthday."<br>

                                  Another year added to the story you live,<br>
                                   filled with moments both simple and profound. <br>
                                   May the sun rise bright and warm,<br>
                                    and may you find joy in the small things.<br>
                                    A good book, a quiet place, the laughter of friends. <br>
                                    Life is a series of days, <br>
                                    each one a chance to find meaning. <br>
                                    Take this day as it comes, <br>
                                    and know that you are valued,<br>
                                    know that you are loved,<br>
                                    know that you are cherished<br>
                                    know that you are longed for<br>
                                     more than words can say. <br>
                                     Here's to more years of living deeply and well.<br>
