          Oooh my sparkle, who took away your light?<br>
          You were the fairest, O ever so bright.<br>
          I have travelled back, unwanted tonight.<br>
          I near wished to leave him behind<br>
          I told him the tale of what is to come<br>
          He let out a smile and said little to none<br>
          Nothing can console a lover of one<br>
          <br>
          I said with words sweeter than honey<br>
          <br>
          A heart drenched, a soul broken<br>
          You will be missed and not forgotten<br>

          <br>

          The year you speak of will be like none<br>
          I will send you back two years and one<br>
          I will keep her happy until it is done<br>
          I will help her sleep, witness be my sun<br>
          Carry my message across the velvety night<br>
          Haste back moon, with all your might<br>
          <br>
          You will not see her tonight in the years to come<br>
          
          It is for her friends and some loved ones<br>
          If what you say is true, I will be none<br>
          Descarded be me, or be thrown like a toy<br>
          I will not have her cry on her day of joy<br>
          <br>
          Come with me and we will make it right<br>
          Do not give up, O Poet you must fight<br>
          With a tear yet again I was sent to tonigt<br>
          To the person I heard was the one most bright<br>
          <br>
          As I streched across the heavens<br> 
          I thought little but of you<br>
          Seasoned changed and I witnessed less <br>
          but two.<br>
          Hearts colliding and fighting over naught<br>
          One a collection of troubling thought<br>
          One always there, O how he fought<br>

          I met a star thought to be lonely<br>
          Despised by all, alwasy so gloomy<br>
          He said I am loved O moon, by somone so lovely<br>
          With eyes sparkling, with cheeks puffy<br>
          I love her, I love her, I love her all night<br>
          I love her moon, she is my delight<br>
          How stupid of all, such an act of folly<br>
          The lonely star is not so lonely<br>
          <br>
          I believe my journey has come to an end<br>
          I have travelled far, seen time bend<br>
          I must now be away and take my leave<br>
          But not until there's a promise to keep<br>
          <br>

          A message from past has come for you<br>
          Do with it what you must<br>
          Fear not what it will do to you<br>
          I was told to deliver and see none<br>
          He said you cannot, there can be just one<br>
          Odd was he when he said this to me<br>
          What could be that I cannot see?<br>
          I am the moon, ever so bright<br>
          I am a celestial with untold might<br>
          But I mustn't break what I said<br>
          You see it dearie, while I go to bed<br>

          <br>

          As one of yours said<br>
          "If I loved you less, I might be able to talk about it more."<br>

          <br>

          "Goodnight ðŸ’œðŸ–¤"

          <br>
          <br>
        

          "Don't be a badtameez, Say(Tap) goodnight to the moon. Kuch nai seekha. <br>
          But before you do that, ak bat man jao<br>
          Gurya apni eyes close kar kay goodnight karna<br>
          You'll know when to open them<br>"
          
        

            ...
